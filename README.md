# Optimalization Dewetting Aluminium
## BEP - Lotte Boonstra

## Goal:
Minimalise the dewetting effects of thin Aluminum layers on SiN substrates through use of adhesion layers or through SiC substrates.

### Secondary:
Quantifying these effects as a function of substrate material or adhesion layer material for a given thermal budget.

## Method:
Obtain images of the samples with the SEM or optical microscope and analyze the images with a python script to obtain the number of holes and the area of the holes.



## Checklist
- [x] Blur image
- [x] Find contours
- [ ] Normalize areas
- [ ] Optional - Automatically detect upper and lower bounds based on image
